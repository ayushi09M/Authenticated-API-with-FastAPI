    "\n",
    "##### 1. What is FastAPI?\n",
    "\n",
    "FastAPI is a **modern Python web framework** used to build **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)** quickly and efficiently.  \n",
    "It is designed to be **fast, easy to use, and reliable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It uses **Starlette** for handling web requests.  \n",
    "* It uses **Pydantic** for validating and managing data.  \n",
    "* It takes advantage of **Python type hints** to make your code more clear and safe.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of FastAPI as a tool that helps you easily create powerful APIs without writing too much code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ In summary:  \n",
    "FastAPI = **Fast + Reliable + Easy + Automatic docs + Validation** â†’ Perfect for modern API development.  \n"

    "##### 2. Why FastAPI? (Advantages)\n",
    "\n",
    "* ðŸš€ **High performance** â†’ Works as fast as Node.js or Go.  \n",
    "* âš¡ **Faster development** â†’ Less boilerplate, quick to write.  \n",
    "* âœ… **Validation built-in** â†’ It automatically checks if the data coming in is correct.  \n",
    "* ðŸ“– **Automatic API documentation** â†’ You donâ€™t need to write docs separately, FastAPI generates them for you.  \n",
    "* ðŸ”„ **Async support** â†’ Can handle multiple requests at the same time efficiently.  \n",
    "* ðŸ›  **Easy to learn** â†’ Similar to Flask, but with more features.  \n",

    "##### 3. Main Features of FastAPI\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the most important features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Speed**\n",
    "   * Itâ€™s one of the fastest frameworks in Python.  \n",
    "   * Useful for production systems where speed matters (like e-commerce, banking, etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Validation**\n",
    "   * You define what type of data you expect (string, number, boolean, etc.).  \n",
    "   * FastAPI automatically checks it for you.  \n",
    "   * This reduces errors and makes APIs safer.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automatic Documentation**\n",
    "   * Two types of docs are automatically available:  \n",
    "     * **Swagger UI** â€“ for interactive testing.  \n",
    "     * **ReDoc** â€“ for reference documentation.  \n",
    "   * Saves a lot of developer time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Python Type Hints**\n",
    "   * Uses Pythonâ€™s type annotations (like `int`, `str`, `float`).  \n",
    "   * Improves readability and helps catch bugs early.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Async & Await Support**\n",
    "   * Handles multiple tasks at the same time (e.g., calling a database, API, or doing I/O work).  \n",
    "   * Great for high-performance applications.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Error Handling**\n",
    "   * Built-in ways to return proper error messages (e.g., \"Not Found\", \"Bad Request\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Dependency Injection System**\n",
    "   * Helps you reuse components easily (like database connections, authentication, etc.).  \n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Security**\n",
    "   * Supports **OAuth2, JWT tokens, API keys** for secure authentication.  \n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Serialization & Deserialization**\n",
    "   * Easily converts data from Python objects to JSON (for output) and JSON to Python objects (for input).  \n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Background Tasks**\n",
    "    * Lets you run tasks in the background while sending a response to the user (e.g., sending an email after signup).  \n",
    "\n",
    "11. **CORS Support**\n",
    "    * Makes it easier for web frontends (React, Angular, Vue) to communicate with the backend.  \n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Production Ready**\n",
    "    * Stable, well-documented, and widely used in real projects like **microservices, ML model deployment, IoT APIs**.  \n"
