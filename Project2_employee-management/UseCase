Understanding of Your Requirements

Use Case: Build a RESTful API to manage employees. Supports:

CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Notifications via email for key actions (new hire, termination)

Data validation (name, email, status)

Reporting counts of Active/Inactive employees, missing name, invalid email, unexpected status

Major Components:

API endpoints: FastAPI routes for Employee, Manager, Department

Data Modeling: Python classes using inheritance/polymorphism

Validation: Regular expressions for email, custom logic for names and status

Data Persistence: JSON file storage, in-memory list/dict

Notification/Automation: Email via smtplib, decorators for logging & authentication, multithreading support

Error Handling: Python exceptions

Reporting: Automated email report

Input Data Sample:

[
  {"id": 1, "name": "Ayushi", "email": "ayushi20malviya@gmail.com", "department": "Engineering", "status": "Active"}
]


Departments: HR, Finance, Engineering

Notification Reporting: Active/inactive count, missing names, invalid emails, unexpected status
